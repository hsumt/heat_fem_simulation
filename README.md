# [WIP] Simulation of Heat Flow using FDMs and FEMs



FDM - Finite Difference Method, numerical technique that employs a Taylor-series-esque approach to approximating the solutions to Partial Differential Equations, such as the one modelable by the Heat Diffusion Equation usually learned in college. Interest STEMmed from the Cal Poly Slo lecture: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUeraiYEdJ4. Beautiful video on Heat Diffusion.
